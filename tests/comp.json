That the world is mad and runs after me, perpetually it hangs over my head in circles. As the stars follow it and the heavenly vault is moving from place to place wanting to follow me. And the sky rapidly gathers its people of stars in order to catch up with my footsteps. Roaring, the old stone mountains seem to follow me, and rivers sparkle, the bubbles bark at me, the forests follow me on storm paths that gather them here, and scatter them there, jumping on the fields. I wonder amazed in thought: Am I flying? Or is the world flying, madly buzzing? Maybe the whole world now suddenly with me, moves away, runs, howls, taking itself away! By waves, generations of wind how they are driven, carrying with them lands, forests, and villages, carrying with them a world on the shore that was spread and through the crude murmurs of a lost world on the forehead of a wave, there is an ear of wheat!

      "right": "We fly. The plain looks like it is flying to me. As I stand still, under a sky carrying the burden of fire, its clouds of stars\u2026 The plain seems to fly! I stand alone under the stable, solitary vault\u2026 But suddenly I feel that my cold chariot, flying out of place with the world, surpasses it in its flight! Suddenly everything moves, the plain follows me with hills, with hills, dark forests, as old mountains rise and flee, flying behind me, breaking through the barren foreheads of the clouds. That the world is mad and runs after me, perpetually it hangs over my head in circles. As the stars follow it and the heavenly vault is moving from place to place wanting to follow me. And the sky rapidly gathers its people of stars in order to catch up with my footsteps. Roaring, the old stone mountains seem to follow me, and rivers sparkle, the bubbles bark at me, the forests follow me on storm paths that gather them here, and scatter them there, jumping on the fields. I wonder amazed in thought: Am I flying? Or is the world flying, madly buzzing? Maybe the whole world now suddenly with me, moves away, runs, howls, taking itself away! By waves, generations of wind how they are driven, carrying with them lands, forests, and villages, carrying with them a world on the shore that was spread and through the crude murmurs of a lost world on the forehead of a wave, there is an ear of wheat! And that ear carried by a river that flooded is me!\u2026"
