The innovative approach belongs to a non-profit organization from California, Ice911. Researchers affiliated with the organization say that the silica beads spread on the surface of the glaciers could reflect the light and heat coming from the Sun. Thus, the melting of the glaciers could be slowed down. The idea came while researchers were trying to find a material with high reflectivity that could help block the rays and heat that melt the glaciers. Silica beads are often used to keep footwear items in the best conditions. Silica dioxide is also a substance commonly found inside rocks. The material has been tested and can help slow down warming. So far, the innovative method has been tested in Alaska where it has shown surprising efficiency. In a scientific paper published by the American Geophysical Union, it is shown that reflectivity has increased between 15 and 20% with the help of silica beads. In the Arctic region, this could translate into a 1.5-degree reduction in glacier temperatures and a 3-degree reduction in sea temperatures. The ice thickness could increase by 50 centimeters. Although the method's effectiveness has been proven, there are still numerous obstacles in the way of its widespread use. First of all, not the entire community is convinced that it will be successful when used on a large scale. Secondly, although the method is relatively inexpensive, the costs could still amount to up to $5 billion if it were used for all areas facing significant temperature increases.

Through the arched windows, behind the panes, I only tremble Long wrinkled curtains, which sparkle like mist. The moon trembles on the woods, it lights up, it increases, Edges of rock, top of a tree, it paints the sky, And the oaks seem like a guard of giants that surround it, Its sunrise guarding it like a secret treasure. Only the white swans, when they float slowly from the reeds, Rulers over the waters, guests of this silence, With outstretched wings they shake and cut it, Sometimes in trembling circles, sometimes in furrows of heat. The ship moves in trembling with the waves of the country, And in the flowering grass, sleepily sighs a woodpecker... There is so much summer in the air, the rumor is so sweet... The knight alone, sighing, looked at the balcony What was loaded with leaves, to hang them through oysters, red rose of \u015eiras and vines-like faces. The breath of the waters intoxicates him, like salt; Over the charm of sweet nature, the guitar drips: \"Oh, show yourself to me again in a long silk robe, Which seems loaded with a silvery dust, I would watch you for a lifetime in your crown of rays, While your white hand the yellow hair smooths it Come! Play with me... with my luck... throw me From your sweet bosom the old meadow flower, Like on the strings of the guitar sounding softly to fall... Ah! The night is so white, as if snow had fallen. Or to the perfumed shade of the boudoir may I come, That scent from the linen cloths may intoxicate me; Cupid, a slovenly page, will hide with his hand , The orb violin of the lamp, my graceful mistress!\" And the silk rustled dry on the floors, between the vases, Between the roses of \u015eiras and the blue lianas; Among the flowers the child laughs and leans over the bars - Like a light face of an angel is the look of the adored - From the balcony she throws him a rose and with her hands to her mouth, She seems to scold him when she whispers warmly; Then he disappears again... he hears footsteps coming down... And going out the door quickly, they grabbed each other's armpits. Arm in arm they walk side by side... they look good together, She beautiful and he young, he tall and she tall. And in the shadow of the shores, the Luntrea now unfolds out to sea with her belly hanging from the mast And slowly advances in the stroke of the shovels, Rocking so much charm and so much beauty... The moon... the whole moon rises, rises such a bath And from shore to shore a path of heat lasts, What on a small rapid where she lays, the golden child, the dream of the eternal fog; And the sweeter the light, the more it clears, the more the waves of the water, the more the shore seems to grow, the forest seems bigger and bigger, as if it's coming closer Together with the moon's disk, ruler of the waters. Again the lindens with broad shade and flowers down to the ground Toward the dark water gently shakes the wind; The flowers fly over the girl's blond head and rain it down... She grabs onto his trunk with both hands And leans her head back: - You amaze me if you don't save... Ah, how fiercely sweet from your lip is your word! How high you now lift a wheelbarrow in your thinking, When your heartache is my only adornment. And with the gentle fire in your voice you want me and make me tremble, It seems to me a love story from other times; All your dreams, your eye is so sad, With its moist depth you consume my whole mind... Give me your black eyes... don't look sideways with them, Because of their night the sweet neighbor, don't get enough of me - I would go blind looking into myself... Oh, listen now, How thousands of waves are speaking with the prophetic stars! The black woods run amok and the blue springs They only tell of our loves And the lights that tremble so cold through the black cetins, All the earth, the lake, the sky... all, all are our friends... You could throw away the rudder and throw away the shovels, According to their own will, let them take us wherever they rush, Because wherever only they would like to carry us, Everywhere happiness... if it is life, if it is death. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Fantasy, fantasy, when we are alone, How often you carry me to the lakes and the sea and through the groves! Where have you seen these unknown countries? When do they take place? Four hundred? Today you don't have a face at all will to lose yourself in her gaze, How do you like it, how do you like to tease the child, Place your arm behind her neck, mouth to mouth, chest to chest, You ask her only with your eyes : \"Do you love me? Tell the truth!\" I would! you barely extended your hand, the ivar jumps at the door, It's a congress of Rubedenians, maybe an uncle, maybe an aunt... You quickly turn your head to one side and you look down humbly... Is it not in the world is this vrun angle for boyfriend? And like the Egyptian mummies, they all sit in a stiff chair, You with clenched hands, more with your fingers hanging, You're smoking a cigarette, counting mustaches And in culinary matters you try to be clever. I'm sick of this life... not sipping its glass, But this mess, this prose is bitter. To sanctify with thousands of tears such a vain instinct What ails the birds even twice a year? You do not live, but another inspires you - he lives, He with your mouth laughs, he rejoices, he whispers, For all your lives are like flowing waves, Neighbor is only the river: the river is the Demiurge. Don't you feel that your love is a foreign love? Crazy! Don't you feel that in bad things you see only miracles? Don't you see that love serves a cause in nature? That it is the cradle of some lives, what are the seeds of hatred? Don't you see that your laughter is in your weeping sons, that it is to blame that the Cain race has not yet sat down? O puppet theater... rumor of human words, Telling like parrots a thousand jokes and stories Without understanding them... After them an actor Talks to himself, says tens of thousands of times What he said centuries apart, what will centuries still say, Until the sun extinguishes it in the deep knee. What the? When the moon creeps through the clouds, through the deserts, you with your world of thoughts after it cling? To slide on the snow-covered streets, To look through the glass windows at the lit lights And see her surrounded by a swarm of summer losers, How does she smile at everyone with her easy thinking? Heard the clanking of spurs and the rustling of dresses, While they twirl their mustaches, and they wink? When she concludes with a look the amorous-understandings, With your ridiculous feeling at her gate to degenerate? Passionate and stubborn do you love her like a child When she's cold and moody like April? Clasping your arms all your mind to lose it? From head to toe do you admire and admire her Like a marble of Paros or a canvas of Corregio, When she is cold and coquettish? You are ridiculous, understand it... Yes... I used to dream of the one who would love me, When I was lost in thought, she would look over my shoulder, I would feel that she is close and she would know what I understand ... From our poor life, we would last a whole novel... I'm not looking anymore... What should I look for? It's the same old song, Thirst for eternal peace that rings in my ears; But the organs are broken and in irregular cries The old song still runs through as in the night the spring jumps. Here and there, a cleaner ray shines through from a Secular Carmen that I once dreamed of. Otherwise it whistles and shouts, escapes and breaks it echoes, They push tumultuous and wild on the string, And in my mind the wind passes, my head burns desolate, Harsh, cold the eternal unfinished song sounds... Where are the clear strings of my life should I tell them?

Din cauza for\u021belor centrifuge, acesta este aplatizat la poli \u0219i bombat la ecuator (cercul imaginar situat la mijlocul distan\u021bei dintre poli care \u00eemparte o planet\u0103 (un glob) \u00een dou\u0103 emisfere egale).\u201d. Drept urmare, \u00een locul unde se afl\u0103 muntele Chimborazo, distan\u021ba dintre suprafa\u021b\u0103 \u0219i centrul planetei este cu aproximativ 21 de km mai mare dec\u00e2t la poli. Astfel, v\u00e2rful s\u0103u se afl\u0103 la 6.384 de kilometri de centrul planetei, \u00een timp ce cel al Everestului, mult mai departe spre nord, este de numai 6.382 kilometri, ceea ce \u00eenseamn\u0103 o diferen\u021b\u0103 de 1.811 de metri fa\u021b\u0103 de Everest.

Polemica privind \u00een\u0103l\u021bimea Everestului ne face s\u0103 ne uit\u0103m la modul \u00een care aceasta a fost stabilit\u0103. Un studiu indian a concluzionat, \u00een 1954, c\u0103 Everestul m\u0103soar\u0103 8.848 metri \u00een\u0103l\u021bime. \u00cens\u0103 acest num\u0103r nu este b\u0103tut \u00een cuie.

However, if the measurement begins from the Earth's center, Chimborazo exceeds Everest by 1.811 meters. Chimborazo is an inactive stratovolcano located in Ecuador, about 150 km southwest of the capital Quito, and which measures approximately 6.384 km from the planet's center. But where does this difference come from? Christophe Basile, a researcher at the Institut de Recherches de Physique du Globe de Grenoble, provides a simple explanation for this phenomenon: \"The Earth is not perfectly spherical. Due to centrifugal forces, it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator (an imaginary circle situated at the midpoint between the poles that divides a planet into two equal hemispheres).\u201d Consequently, in the place where Mount Chimborazo is located, the distance between the surface and the planet's center is about 21 km greater than at the poles. Therefore, its summit is located at 6.384 km from the planet's center, while Everest's summit, much farther north, is only 6.382 km from the center. In this measurement, Everest is even surpassed by several Andean peaks, as well as by the highest peak in Africa, Kilimanjaro.\n\"And we could have a new measurement if we take into account the height of a peak starting from the bottom of the ocean,\" Basile says. \"In this case, Mauna Kea, in Hawaii, would be the highest, with 10.210 meters.\" In this case, Everest would regain the title from Chimborazo.\nThe polemic about Everest's height makes us forget about how it was determined. An Indian study concluded in 1954 that Everest measured 8.848 meters in height. However, this number is not etched in stone. For example, in 1992, the Italians established that Everest measured 8.845.9 meters, while the Americans measured 8.849.9 meters. After the powerful earthquake in Nepal in 2015, some geologists declared that Everest had \"lost\" 3 centimeters in height, prompting reactions from Nepal, which accused China of wanting to impose new standards. \"What if a country decided to lower your mountains in height without consulting you first?\" asked Uddhi Narayan Shrestha, former director of the country's geological research department, in an interview with New York Times. As a result, the Nepalese government prepared a team of Sherpas equipped with GPS to measure the height of Mount Everest again. \"A senseless diplomatic conflict. All height references are, in fact, mere conventions. For example, the height of Mont Blanc varies from one season to another, depending on the snow layer,\" Basile adds. So, is the current measurement, which starts from sea level, correct? Some would say no, given that it varies depending on waves or tides. In France, for example, the level of the port of Marseille serves as a reference and is defined by the mean sea level between 1885 and 1897. Each country has subsequently defined its \"zero point\" in a similar way.", "right": "Title: Everest is not the world's highest mountain peak Content: In measurements starting from sea level, Everest reaches 8,848 metres high, well above Chimborazo, which rises to 6,263 metres above sea level.

Christophe Basile, a researcher at the Grenoble Institute of Earth Sciences, offers a simple explanation: \"The Earth is not perfectly spherical. Because of centrifugal forces, it is flattened at the poles and domed at the equator (the imaginary circle midway between the poles that divides a planet (a globe) into two equal hemispheres).\" As a result, at the location of Mount Chimborazo, the distance between the surface and the centre of the planet is about 21 km greater than at the poles. Thus, its summit is 6,384 kilometres from the planet's centre, while Everest's, much further north, is only 6,382 kilometres, a difference of 1,811 metres from Everest. Chimborazo is one degree south of the equator and the Earth's diameter at the equator is higher than the latitude at which Mount Everest (8848 m above sea level) lies, north by almost 28\u00b0, with sea level also high. Despite the lower altitude of 2580 m, Chimborazo's summit is 6,384.4 km from the centre of the Earth, 2,168 m further away than the summit of Mount Everest (6,382.3 km from the centre of the Earth). In this measurement, Everest is surpassed by several Andean peaks as well as Africa's highest peak, Kilimanjaro. \"And we may have a new measurement if we consider the height of a peak from the ocean floor. In this case, Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is the tallest at 10,210 metres,\" says Basile. In this case, Everest would win over Mount Chimborazo. The controversy over Everest's height makes us look at how it was determined. An Indian study concluded in 1954 that Everest is 8,848 metres high. But this number is not set in stone.

As a result, the Nepalese government has prepared a team of GPS-equipped mountain climbers to re-measure the height of Everest. \"A diplomatic war that makes no sense. All the altitudes that serve as references are in fact conventions. For example, the height of Mont Blanc changes from one season to the next, depending on the snow cover,\" says Christophe Basile. So is the current measurement, which starts at sea level, correct or not? Some would say not, as the sea level varies according to tides and waves. For example, in France, the width of the port of Marseille is used as a reference point and is defined by the mean sea level between 1885 and 1897. Each country has subsequently defined its \"zero point\" in a similar way, which is also generally accepted by the international community. Until the controversy surrounding the world's highest peak is cleared up, geologists have good news for tourists: you can brag about climbing the highest peak on the planet by climbing the Chimborazo volcano.

If it's how it started, I'll take my suitcase and move. Have you seen shamelessness? On Saturday, midday, Without any notice, He came, settled in And started playing. I, like a man sitting down, I don't put my hand on the piano Except rarely, from year to year, On the oboe or the harpsichord: Not to upset the neighbor - But then with measure And with my finger to my mouth, I sing some polka or some hora, Until' at a certain time.

I had found myself, under the curtain, in a corner of the room, I saw him, he was shaking, and he could no longer sing. Wet, lioness, hoarse, Her soft voice is whining, And the bear caricature has forgotten to walk, I feel sorry for her humble creature. Suffering hurts me. I was ready to kill him. Should I kill him because why is he singing? This thought terrifies me. Does anyone know where his Life comes from? All he can do, anywhere, is to sing sweet dirges, And how silly he is. Only his mouth is his. Like a trumpet - and don't you say There are ten musics in the ears? He knows that much. alas, the poor man, To sing, - like the pitpalac, And - he has the vile right Not to sing beautifully either. His speech is such that his people understand it too.

I have scolded him five times, and he woke me up five times, an annoying guest. I'm trembling, listening, waiting For the enemy to strike a blow, but he, quiet and sneaky, plays the flute and the fiddle; Sometimes it seems, as if, On bottles with broken glass, he's trying something, Or teasing someone from afar, The broken bottle pieces and the jugs, He has many and enough, And jiggles, but also shakes. And then? I took water in my mouth And pulled him out of a crack. I was hiding, under a sheet, In a corner of the bedding, I saw him scratching, and he couldn't sing anymore.

I don't have the expertise to judge a doctoral work,\" the prime minister said in an interview with News. ro news agency. Dacian Ciolos said that, as prime minister, he wanted to ensure that this structure, the CNATDCU, operates on the basis of clear regulations, clear principles and professional people \"who are able to take these decisions. And so far, through the decisions they have taken, we have only seen that this has been the case,\" Dacian Ciolos said in the interview, which will be broadcast in full on Friday. The chief prosecutor of DNA, Laura Codru\u021ba Kovesi, did not plagiarise in her doctoral thesis, the National Council for the Attestation of University Degrees, Diplomas and Certificates (CNATDCU) ruled on Thursday, pointing out that the withdrawal of her doctoral degree would be an excessive and inappropriate decision. The working committee noted in the report that was adopted by the General Council of the CNATDCU that Laura Codru\u021ba Kovesi's doctoral thesis shows passages taken from documents without citing them according to the academic norm, but these represent about 20 pages out of 444, which is almost 4% of the thesis. Education Minister Mircea Dumitru said after the decision of the CNADTCU that universities with \"zero tolerance for copying\" in cases similar to that of Codruta Kovesi are asked to redo the thesis and it is not defended. The minister said that if there are any appeals against the CNATDCU decision, they will certainly be considered. Marius Andruh, vice-president of the CNATDCU, explained that 1% of the thesis passages that may fall under the plagiarism classification can be a serious thing if they are found in the original contributions part. \"You can steal an epoch-making idea from a great scholar, it doesn't have to be 100 pages long that idea is in development,\" the CNATDCU vice-president explained. But experts who have reviewed the paper say that the information taken from the passages is not an important part of the paper and that it is about general ideas used by everyone writing in the field, so withdrawing the academic distinction would be an exaggeration. \"The Commission therefore proposed not to withdraw the doctoral title, i.e. to retain the doctoral title. As you have seen, the sanction is excessive and out of proportion to the few similarities found. In the lady's thesis there is no question of the part of the original contribution having been plagiarised from somewhere, not even whole pages or whole chapters. These are matters of minor importance or which have already entered the common language of the field. For example, page 30-33 of the thesis contains general ideas used by absolutely everyone who has written in the field, even if the wording in the paper seems to be taken without citation from another author\", explained Mircea Bob, Vice-President of the CNATDCU. On 30 September 2016, the DNA chief said that her PhD thesis contains 444 pages and 442 footnotes and that the work involved the study of 286 bibliographical sources, including 103 treatises, courses and monographs, 71 articles published in scholarly articles, 27 sources of national legislation, 20 sources of international legislation and 65 online sources (websites). \"I came prepared with the evidence that I submitted in 2012 to that committee (n. r. the arguments presented to the committee in 2012).

Prosecutor-General Laura Codru\u021ba Kovesi did not plagiarize in her doctoral thesis, CNATDCU decided, Thursday, which noted that the revocation of the doctoral title would be an excessive and inappropriate decision. The working group noted in the report submitted to the General Council of CNATDCU that Kovesi's doctoral thesis contained passages taken from documents without proper citation, but these represented approximately 4% of the thesis, or about 18 pages. Minister of Education Mircea Dumitru declared, following CNATDCU's decision, that at universities with a \"zero tolerance policy\" in similar cases, such as that of Kovesi, the thesis was required to be rewritten and not presented. The minister stated that, if there were objections to CNATDCU's decision, they would certainly be analyzed.

Dana Zamfir, daughter of the deceased old man: \"There was the Collective, there was a big fuss then and what was solved, so many people died then and nothing was done, was something inaugurated, a new ward?\" The man was seriously injured mid last month when the block he lived in was destroyed by a powerful explosion caused by leaking methane gas. Three residents were injured, and the survivors are horrified: they could have been in the neighbour's place, for whom there was no room at the hospital in time. Survivor: \"Maybe he would have had a chance if he had been transported to Bucharest in the first place He deserved a chance at life\"."}, {"id": 50, "meta": {"left": "deepl", "right": "gcloud", "dataset": "RoSent", "row_id": 1708, "is_target": false}, "original": "si acest film nu o sa moara in veci:) de fiecare data de craciun il urmaresc...e singuru care mi-am placut 1 parte mi-a placut cel mai mult:)", "left": "and this movie will never die:) every christmas i watch it...it's the only one i liked 1 part i liked the most:)", "right": "and this movie won't die forever:) every Christmas I watch it...it's the only one I liked, I liked part 1 the most:)"}, {"id": 167, "meta": {"left": "mistral", "right": "gcloud", "dataset": "RoTextSummarization", "row_id": 2913, "is_target": true}, "original": "Pre\u0219edintele Klaus Iohannis propune o nou\u0103 garnitur\u0103 de ambasadori, dup\u0103 ce zilele trecute a semnat decretele de revocare a numai pu\u021bin de 31 de diploma\u021bi.

Many parents have discovered that, on the contrary, if they are physically near the child, it is not enough for him. Here is the testimony of a mother, a project manager: \"Many frustrations arise from the child, he repeatedly comes to me and says: leave the laptop, you don't have time for me again, why are you always busy. Although he would have the opportunity to spend a lot of time outdoors, he prefers to spend hours in front of the TV, because this makes him feel closer to me physically.\" A psychotherapist tells you that this kind of reaction is understandable: \"The child experiences loneliness in these moments and even feels a sense of rejection.\" Here is how you can help your child understand the situation and not feel rejected: \"Let's explain to them that even though we are at home, we have limited time for them.

Many parents have found that, on the contrary, being physically near their child is not enough for them. Here's the testimony of one mother, a project manager: \"A lot of frustration comes from the child, he repeatedly comes to me and says: leave the laptop, you don't have time for me, why are you always busy. Although he would have the opportunity to spend a lot of time outdoors, he prefers to spend hours in front of the TV, because it makes him physically closer to me\". A psychotherapist tells you that this kind of reaction is understandable: \"The child experiences loneliness at these moments and even experiences a feeling of rejection\". Here's how you can help your child understand the situation and not feel rejected: \"Explain to them that although we are at home we have limited time for them. It's good to introduce physical activities to counteract the effects of this stress we all go through. Let's ask them how they feel, let them share the emotions they are experiencing, and let them play what they feel, draw pictures or do a puppet show.

He estimates that up to 800 fighters are guarding the plant, led by the Azov Battalion, a nationalist militia, but which has been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard. It is a group that Russia considers \"neo-Nazi\". \"These fighters don't want to be captured, I don't think they will surrender. And Russia doesn't want to go into the plant and clean it out metre by metre, because underground, that could prove horrible,\" he said. Ukraine has managed to refuel its besieged forces in Mariupol in very risky night missions, Justin Crump added, without specifying where he got this information. The steel mill is a key industrial target and if Russia takes control of it, \"maybe the Chinese will be the ones to get it back up and running because they are interested in its steel,\" Crump said. But it will take years to rebuild Mariupol, which has been devastated, he added. The plant owned by Rinat Ahmetov has become the town's last stronghold in the southeast. It has been a refuge for Ukrainian soldiers, who are outnumbered and outgunned by Russian forces. But the plant is so big that the Russians simply can't find the Ukrainians, so they've started talking about a chemical attack as the only way to get them out, the Guardian reported the other day.The Azovstal steel plant is one of Europe's largest metallurgical plants and sits in an industrial zone covering more than 11 square kilometres overlooking the Sea of Azov. Metinvest, which owns the Azovstal combine, has given assurances that its steel plants will never work \"under Russian occupation\", and Rinat Ahmetov has said he will always consider Mariupol a Ukrainian city and has promised to return after the war to help rebuild it. The Ukrainian military reported new air strikes by Russian forces on Mariupol on Sunday, after the rejection of a Russian ultimatum for local fighters to surrender to Russian forces besieging the city, reports AFP, picked up by Agerpres. Russian troops have focused their attacks on the port city and the Azovstal steel mill, both scenes of fierce battles for days. Russia had previously threatened to annihilate the troops barricaded in the steelworks if they did not surrender. But the Ukrainians rejected Russia's ultimatum to lay down their arms and surrender by noon on Sunday. Ukrainian units, including 400 foreign mercenaries, are holed up in the Azovstal steelworks, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konatzenkov said. About 2,500 fighters are in the plant, according to Russian sources, who said Saturday that the town is under Russian control. President Volodimir Zelensky said he would do everything possible to save Mariupol, a city of vital strategic importance to both sides in the conflict. He also warned that he would abandon peace talks with Russia if Ukrainian fighters were killed.Ukraine's prime minister also said soldiers would fight to the end, even though they still control only the Azovstal plant, and Putin's military would also prepare a naval sortie to attack the defenders from two directions. Moscow accuses Volodymyr Zelensky of not making concessions in the negotiations, and analysts have indeed noted a change of tone on the part of the Ukrainian leader, who may be emboldened precisely by the fact that there is still a hold on Mariupol. \"We will not give up our territory,\" the Kiev leader told CNN on Sunday, adding that the fight for the Donbas region could shape the outcome of the war as a whole, meaning Ukraine must hold firm to its position. Volodymyr Zelensky said dialogue with Russia was important if possible, but added that it was difficult given the atrocities committed in Bucea and other parts of the country. \"Our society does not want to continue talks\" with Russia, the Ukrainian president said, adding that what happened was a \"great tragedy\".President Zelenski also renewed his calls for the West to send more military equipment to the Ukrainian army as soon as possible.", "right": "Title: Azovstal Steelworks in Mariupol is well prepared for defense - British military analyst\nContent: Justin Crump, from the security consulting firm Sibylline, told BBC that the Ukrainians are \"well prepared for defense\", after having had over 50 days to fortify the site and build evacuation routes. \"I suspect that, if nothing is disrupted, they will remain there for a long time - they can do unpleasant things at night and then return inside,\" the expert suggested.

Russian troops focused their attacks on the city-port and the Azovstal steelworks, scenes of intense fighting for days. Russia had threatened earlier to annihilate the barricaded troops in the steelworks if they did not surrender. Ukrainian forces rejected the Russian ultimatum to lay down their arms and surrender by Sunday at noon. Units of the Ukrainian army, including 400 foreign mercenaries, are hiding in the Azovstal steelworks, according to the Russian defense ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov. Roughly 2,500 fighters are in the plant, according to Russian sources, who announced on Saturday that the city was under Russian control. President Zelensky said he would do everything possible to save Mariupol, an strategically important city for both sides in the conflict. He also warned that he would abandon peace talks with Russia if Ukrainian fighters are killed.\nAnd the prime minister of Ukraine also said that soldiers will fight to the end, despite controlling only the Azovstal steelworks, while Russian forces are preparing a naval landing to attack the defenders from two directions. Moscow accuses Volodymyr Zelensky of not making concessions in peace talks, while analysts have noted a change in tone from the Ukrainian leader, who could potentially be open to peace negotiations."}, {"id": 60, "meta": {"left": "mistral", "right": "chatgpt3.5", "dataset": "Rupert", "row_id": 1148, "is_target": false}, "original": "Oglindiri\nAmiaza verii doarme \u00een odaie\n\u0218i ceasul a t\u0103cut.\nCu umbr\u0103 lui fereastr\u0103 iar o taie\nUn ram, de ani nemaiv\u0103zut.\nM-am de\u0219teptat, sau somnul tot m\u0103 \u021bine?\nOdaia n-o mai \u0219tiu.\nDin apele oglinzii \u00eemi revine,\nUitat, acest iatac pustiu.\nInvers \u0219i clar trecutul \u00een oglind\u0103\nSfideaz\u0103 omul de-azi,\n\u0218i \u00een cle\u0219tar vr\u00e2nd via\u021b\u0103 lui s-o prind\u0103\nR\u0103spunde mut cu alt obraz.\nTu, ce-n oglind\u0103 ai r\u0103mas aieve\nC\u00e2nd dibuiesc prin vis,\nNu m\u0103 privi sub ramul f\u0103r\u0103 seve,\n\u00cen limpezi nemuriri \u00eenchis.\nNu m\u0103 privi nostalgic - f\u0103r\u0103 veste\nM-oi \u0219terge ca-n oglinzi\nDe ape, norul dac\u0103 trece peste\nStr\u0103inul chip ce nu-l cuprinzi.", "left": "Mirrors at dusk sleep in the room And time fell silent.

Different countries and regions have created specific sandwiches, such as the \"Italian submarine sandwich,\" which consists of ham, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, Italian cheese, and red onion. A classic Reuben sandwich contains corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. A Cuban sandwich contains ham, pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard. A \"Philly cheesesteak sandwich\" contains steak, onions, and cheese. The largest sandwich was made in 2005 and weighed over 2 tons. In 2019, a record of 57,662 sandwiches was prepared in an hour. On average, over 300 million sandwiches are consumed daily in the USA."}, {"id": 201, "meta": {"left": "chatgpt3.5", "right": "gcloud", "dataset": "RoTextSummarization", "row_id": 4508, "is_target": true}, "original": "Pre\u0219edintele Klaus Iohannis sus\u021bine ideea ca oamenii care doresc s\u0103 munceasc\u0103 \u00een continuare, dup\u0103 v\u00e2rsta de pensionare, s\u0103 poat\u0103 face acest lucru p\u00e2n\u0103 la 70 de ani.

Rallies in solidarity with Alexei Navalnny took place in numerous Russian cities. According to the civic organization OVD-Info, over 300 protestors were detained, primarily in the cities of Kemerovo, Barnaul, Ufa, Novokuznetsk, Moscow, and St. Petersburg.

She was also sentenced to one year of labor for entering a house without permission. The Navalny protest scheduled for that evening was to take place simultaneously with a speech by President Vladimir Putin about the state of the nation.

To comply with COVID-19 protection measures, most Romanians searched on Google \"how to wear a mask\". They wanted to know \"how to put on a mask\" as well. They wanted to learn all about coronavirus: \"how does coronavirus manifest itself\" and \"how is coronavirus transmitted\". Because many Romanians spent more time at home in 2020, they searched on Google \"how to make sourdough starter\", \"how to make yeast\" or \"how to cook asparagus\". Even though coronavirus was in the spotlight, it found its place among the Romanians' searches alongside major topics of interest in 2020, such as the U.S. elections or Black Friday. The U.S. elections were among the most popular searches, and Romanians did not forget to search \"when is Black Friday 2020\". Among movies, the most popular in Romanians' Google searches in 2020 were the Polish movie \"365 Days\", the Romanian comedy \"Miami Bici\" and \"Contagion\", a film that gained popularity alongside the COVID-19 pandemic. Romanians cooked more this year, and the most searched recipes were donuts, banana bread, and bread. In terms of diets, this year's top spot goes to a new entry among the most searched diets on Google in recent years, the Sirtfood diet, and in terms of sports events, the major tennis tournaments remain the most searched. The top searches on Google in 2020 were compiled using \"trending\" search lists: searches that saw a significant increase in 2020 compared to 2019, over a considerable period of time, indicating a heightened and sustained interest in that particular subject. The searches for the year 2020 cover multiple categories, aiming to capture search trends from Romania in the ending year. The lists were created using a combination of several services and tools that offer us a detailed view of search trends on a global and regional level. Most of the data comes from Google Trends, a public service that presents search volume on different geographical regions, time periods, and terms used."}, {"id": 169, "meta": {"left": "mistral", "right": "gcloud", "dataset": "RoTextSummarization", "row_id": 4041, "is_target": true}, "original": "Gr\u0103dini\u0163ele \u015fi \u015fcolile particulare risc\u0103 falimentul.

Romania Lags Behind European Partners\nContent: The United Kingdom and the United States are making efforts to vaccinate their citizens as vaccination is the most effective way to stop the pandemic. Romania lags behind in vaccination even with European partners, but vaccinates more than Costa Rica, Argentina, or France. The latest information about the anti-Covid vaccination campaign comes from my colleague Felix Damian. Nearly 6 million Romanians have already received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine. In Romania, healthcare personnel are prioritized for vaccination, while in other countries, the elderly, chronically ill, and other vulnerable categories have quick access to vaccination. The most vaccinations are being administered in Israel, where more than 90% of the population has been vaccinated. Bahrain follows with 3.4%, Iceland with 1.4%, the UK with 1.18%, and the United States with less than 1% of their populations vaccinated. The UK is the first country to offer its citizens two vaccines: one from Pfizer and the second from AstraZeneca. British experts have come to the conclusion that it is worth prioritizing the first dose and therefore vaccinate as many people as possible. To do this, doctors in the UK will delay the administration of the second dose by up to three months after the first injection. Studies show that the first dose offers protection of up to 70% within 22 days. Of course, there are opposing views on this idea, but projections show that without massive vaccination, there could be more deaths from Covid-19 in 2021 than in the previous year. The AstraZeneca vaccine produced in collaboration with the University of Oxford will not be available in January. The European Medicines Agency has not yet received the necessary information from the vaccine producer, and it seems that these formalities will further delay the process. AstraZeneca has, however, provided enough data to British authorities, who have urgently approved this vaccine for UK citizens and have planned to increase production to 100 million doses per month.", "right": "Title: The country with the most vaccinations.

You shall never enter the depths of this enemy. I will barricade my doors heavily, Smile of yours from behind should not penetrate my home. And how? but you understand, don't you? With such jealousy, What thoughts are burning in your heart and tearing it apart? I was wondering, can one be so beautiful With heart and mind, not loved? Because you are too beautiful... Your lips are craving, Your sweetness is kind, You could be a thorn in the side Of so many warm words whispered with pain, What air filled with comforting caresses? Could you resist being next to one so sweet And delicious, a woman? Knowing that an arrow from the bow of the one with genes Is the very pain of earthly life, The venom knowing that it is the kiss of Friday, The venom was my breathe and your young eyes, And I didn't want the dance of sweet flattery To ignite my soul on the altar of suffering; My thoughts' flight, my pride from singing, I didn't want a smile of yours to extinguish... You looked at me strangely and wondered why I was silent... You didn't even imagine that in my mind I was undressing You with my thoughts, Of white and tender flesh and bones, Of a proud idol, Whose terrifying eyes, like hands without a body, Were extending over you, ready to destroy, And yet you were beautiful and soft, I was looking at you as if I were looking at a cold corpse. But you won... You entered my heart And now you shine like a fatal star over the seas On my thoughts... and you passed by so beautifully."}]}
